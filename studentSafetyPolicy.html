    <p>
        As we work to accomplish our mission of providing high quality coding education to under-represented
        communities, student safety must always remain our highest priority. In order to protect students and the
        teachers interacting with them, this document establishes the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Guidelines for OpenBrackets teachers</li>
        <li>A training policy for OpenBrackets teachers</li>
        <li>Steps that will be taken in response to a student safety incident</li>
    </ol>

    <br>

    <h2>1. Guideline for Teachers</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="h4">1 (a) Rules for teachers during teaching session</h3>
    <div>
        OpenBrackets teachers and teaching assistants shall follow these rules when interacting with students:
        <ul>
            <li>OpenBrackets staff, volunteers, and board members will comply with the <a
                    href="/studentInformationPolicy.html">Student Information Policy</a>,
                including regarding storage of student information and recording of photos.
            </li>
            <li>Teachers shall meet with students in-person or remotely only through OpenBrackets sponsored events
                and classes.
            </li>
            <li>
                All interactions will take place through official OpenBrackets communication channels such that the
                interaction is accessible to other students, OpenBrackets teachers, staff, and/or board members.
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, all video conferencing, such as Zoom, shall take place in the official
                        OpenBrackets video-conference meeting that is designated for the event.
                    </li>
                    <li>For example, all email communication will copy (CC) email to an official OpenBrackets email
                        address, to which multiple people have access.
                    </li>
                    <li>For example, communication on Discord must take place where other teachers and staff have
                        full access to the conversation. Private DMs are not permitted.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Barring a technical emergency, teachers shall have their cameras turned on when interacting with
                students.
            </li>
            <li>Dress Code: Teachers shall dress appropriately when interacting with students.</li>
            <li>If teachers need to take a break, they should first notify the other teacher(s), then turn off their
                camera and microphone.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3 class="h4">1 (b) Rules for teachers outside of teaching sessions</h3>
    <div>
        OpenBrackets teachers and teaching assistants must also follow these rules outside of a class session.
        <ul>
            <li>Teachers shall not correspond with a student privately through their phone calls, texts, or
                non-OpenBrackets social media accounts for any reason. All email communication with students must be
                using or copying emails to the official OpenBrackets email address, <a
                        href="mailto:contact@openbrackets.us">contact@openbrackets.us</a>. All inbound student emails to
                a staff member’s or teacher’s personal email must be forwarded to an official OpenBrackets email
                address.
            </li>
            <li>Teachers shall not fraternize with students.</li>
        </ul>
        Exceptions to these rules can be made under certain conditions, such as when a teacher and a student has an
        existing familial relationship. In such cases, the teacher must notify the OpenBrackets board prior to the
        student’s first class session. However, exceptions to these rules must remain <i>exceptional</i>.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>2. Training for Teachers</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
        New OpenBrackets teachers and teaching assistants are required to read this document before they participate
        in a class session. In addition all teachers and teaching assistants must review this document at least once
        every subsequent year.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>3. Incident Response and Remediation</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="h4">3 (a) Immediate Response</h3>

            <li>If the incident is serious enough, an emergency Board meeting shall be held as soon as possible.

                authorities will be immediately notified.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

            </li>
        </ol>
